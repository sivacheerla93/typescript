# introduction
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

TypeScript is pure object oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed.

It is projected as scalable JavaScript. It is known as JavaScript that scales.

It is the preferred language to build Angular 2 applications as Angular 2 itself was written in TypeScript.

It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg (designer of C#) at Microsoft.
